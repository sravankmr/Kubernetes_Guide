# Server components

1. ## Master Node

* **API Server**

  This is the communication hub for all cluster components. It exposes the Kubernetes API.

* **Scheduler**

  Assigns the pods to a worker node. Auto-detects which pod to assign to which node based on resource requirement\[vCPU/mem], hardware constraints, etc.

* **Controller Manager**

  Maintains the cluster. Handles node failures, replicating components, maintaining the correct amount of pods, etc.

* **etcd**

  Stores the cluster configuration.

1. ## Worker Node

* **Kubelet**

  Runs and manages the containers on the node and talks to the API Server.

* **Kube-proxy**

  Load balances traffic between application components.

* **Container runtime**

  The program that runs your containers (docker, rkt, containerd...).
