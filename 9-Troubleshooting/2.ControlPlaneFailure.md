The Kubernetes Control Plane is an important component to back up and protect against failure. 

There are certain best practices you can take to ensure you donâ€™t have a single point of failure. 

If your Control Plane components are not effectively communicating, there are a few things you can check to ensure your cluster is operating efficiently.

###### Hands-on

* Get the logs from the individual pods in your kube-system namespace and check for errors

`kubectl logs [kube_scheduler_pod_name] -n kube-system`

* Check the status of the Docker service

    `sudo systemctl status docker`

* Start up and enable the Docker service, so it starts upon bootup

    `sudo systemctl enable docker && systemctl start docker`

* Check the status of the kubelet service

    `sudo systemctl status kubelet`

* Check the events in the kube-system namespace for errors

`kubectl get events -n kube-system`

* Start up and enable the kubelet service, so it starts up when the machine is rebooted

    `sudo systemctl enable kubelet && systemctl start kubelet`

* Turn off swap on your machine

```
sudo su -
swapoff -a && sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
```

* Check if you have a firewall running

    `sudo systemctl status firewalld`

* Disable the firewall and stop the firewalld service

    `sudo systemctl disable firewalld && systemctl stop firewalld`
