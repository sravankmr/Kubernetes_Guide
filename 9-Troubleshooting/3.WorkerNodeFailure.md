Troubleshooting worker node failure is a lot like troubleshooting a non-responsive server, in addition to the kubectl tools we have at our disposal. 

In this lesson, weâ€™ll learn how to recover a node and add it back to the cluster and find out how to identify when the kublet service is down.

### Hands-on

* Listing the status of the nodes should be the first step

    `kubectl get nodes`

* Find out more information about the nodes with kubectl describe

    `kubectl describe nodes chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com`

* You can try to log in to your server via SSH

    `ssh chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com`

* Get the IP address of your nodes

    `kubectl get nodes -o wide`

* Use the IP address to further probe the server

    `ssh cloud_user@172.31.29.182`

* Generate a new token after spinning up a new server

    `sudo kubeadm token generate`

* Create the kubeadm join command for your new worker node

    `sudo kubeadm token create [token_name] --ttl 2h --print-join-command`

* View the journalctl logs

    `sudo journalctl -u kubelet`

* View the syslogs

    `sudo more syslog | tail -120 | grep kubelet`

### Networking-Failure related commands

* List the services in your cluster

    `kubectl get svc`

* Create a service by exposing a port on the deployment

    `kubectl expose deployment hostnames --port=80 --target-port=9376`

* Run an interactive busybox pod

    `kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never busybox --image=busybox:1.28 sh`

* From the pod, check if DNS is resolving hostnames

    `# nslookup hostnames`

* From the pod, cat out the /etc/resolv.conf file

    `# cat /etc/resolv.conf`

* From the pod, look up the DNS name of the Kubernetes service

    `# nslookup kubernetes.default`

* Get the JSON output of your service

    `kubectl get svc hostnames -o json`
