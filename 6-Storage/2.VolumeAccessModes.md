Volume access modes are how you specify the access of a node to your Persistent Volume. 

There are three types of access modes: 
* **ReadWriteOnce**: The volume can be mounted as *Read-Write* by a **single node**
* **ReadOnlyMany**: The Volume can be mounted *Read-Only* by **many nodes**
* **ReadWriteMany**: The volume can be mounted *Read-Write* by **many nodes**

* The YAML for a Persistent Volume
