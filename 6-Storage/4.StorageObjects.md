There’s an even easier way to provision storage in Kubernetes with StorageClass objects. 

Also, your storage is safe from data loss with the “Storage Object in Use Protection” feature, which ensures any pods using a Persistent Volume will not lose the data on the volume as long as it is actively mounted. 

We’ve been using Google Storage for this section (that's why Gcloud storage may not work in all environents), but there are many different volume types you can use in Kubernetes. 

These are some of the storage clases from the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes):

* emptyDir
* configMap
* local
* hostPath
* persistentVolumeClaim
* secret

### Hands-on

* See the PV protection on your volume

  `kubectl describe pv mongodb-pv`

* See the PVC protection for your claim

  `kubectl describe pvc mongodb-pvc`

* Delete the PVC

  `kubectl delete pvc mongodb-pvc`

* See that the PVC is terminated, but the volume is still attached to pod

  `kubectl get pvc`

* Create the StorageClass type "fast"

  `kubectl apply -f sc-fast.yaml`

* Try to access the data, even though we just deleted the PVC

```
kubectl exec -it mongodb mongo`
use mystore
`db.foo.find()
```

* Delete the pod, which finally deletes the PVC

  `kubectl delete pods mongodb`

* Show that the PVC is deleted

  `kubectl get pvc`

* YAML for a StorageClass object
  
```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
```

* Change the PVC to include the new StorageClass object
  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongodb-pvc 
spec:
  storageClassName: fast
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
```

* Create the PVC with automatically provisioned storage

  `kubectl apply -f mongodb-pvc.yaml`

* View the PVC with new StorageClass

  `kubectl get pvc`

* View the newly provisioned storage

  `kubectl get pv`

* The YAML for a hostPath PV
  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-hostpath
spec:
  storageClassName: local-storage
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

* The YAML for a pod with an empty directory volume
  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: emptydir-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    name: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp/storage
      name: vol
  volumes:
  - name: vol
    emptyDir: {}
```
