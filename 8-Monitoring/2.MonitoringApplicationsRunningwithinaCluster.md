There are ways Kubernetes can automatically monitor your apps for you and, furthermore, fix them by either restarting or preventing them from affecting the rest of your service. 

You can insert liveness probes and readiness probes to do just this for custom monitoring of your applications.

A **Probe** is a diagnostic performed by the Kubelet on a Container.

The kubelet can perform and react to three kind of probes:
* **livenessProbe**: Indicates whether the **Container is running**. If it **fails**, the kubelet **kills the container** and the container is subjected to its restart policy.
* **readinessProbe**: Indicates whether the **container is ready to service requests**. If the readiness probe **fails**, the endpoints controller **removes the pod's IP address from the endpoints of all services that match the Pod**.
* **startupProbe**: Indicates whether the **application within the container is started**. If it **fails**, the Kubelet **kills the container** and the container is subjected to its restart policy.

### Hands-on

* The pod YAML for a liveness probe

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - image: linuxacademycontent/kubeserve
    name: kubeserve
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
```

* The YAML for a service and two pods with readiness probes

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginxpd
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:191
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

* Create the service and two pods with readiness probes

  `kubectl apply -f readiness.yaml`

* Check if the readiness check passed or failed

  `kubectl get pods`

* Check if the failed pod has been added to the list of endpoints

  `kubectl get ep`

* Edit the pod to fix the problem and enter it back into the service

  `kubectl edit pod [pod_name]`

* Get the list of endpoints to see that the repaired pod is part of the service again

  `kubectl get ep`
