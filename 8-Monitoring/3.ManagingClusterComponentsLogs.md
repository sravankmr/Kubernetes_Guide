There are many ways to manage the logs that can accumulate from both applications and system components.  

### Hands-on

* The directory where the container logs reside

  `/var/log/containers`

* The directory where kubelet stores its logs

  `/var/log`

* The YAML for a pod that has two different log streams

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - >
      i=0;
      while true;
      do
        echo "$i: $(date)" >> /var/log/1.log;
        echo "$(date) INFO $i" >> /var/log/2.log;
        i=$((i+1));
        sleep 1;
      done
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:
  - name: varlog
    emptyDir: {}
```

* Create a pod that has two different log streams to the same directory

  `kubectl apply -f twolog.yaml`

* View the logs in the /var/log directory of the container

  `kubectl exec counter -- ls /var/log`

* The YAML for a sidecar container that will tail the logs for each type

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - >
      i=0;
      while true;
      do
        echo "$i: $(date)" >> /var/log/1.log;
        echo "$(date) INFO $i" >> /var/log/2.log;
        i=$((i+1));
        sleep 1;
      done
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  - name: count-log-1
    image: busybox
    args: [/bin/sh, -c, 'tail -n+1 -f /var/log/1.log']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  - name: count-log-2
    image: busybox
    args: [/bin/sh, -c, 'tail -n+1 -f /var/log/2.log']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:
  - name: varlog
    emptyDir: {}
```

* View the first type of logs separately

  `kubectl logs counter count-log-1`

* View the second type of logs separately

  `kubectl logs counter count-log-2`
* Tail the logs to only view a certain number of lines

    `kubectl logs --tail=20 nginx`

* View the logs from a previous time duration

    `kubectl logs --since=1h nginx`

* View the logs from a container within a pod within a deployment

    `kubectl logs deployment/nginx -c nginx`

* Get a response from the metrics server API

    `kubectl get --raw /apis/metrics.k8s.io/`

* Get the CPU and memory utilization of the nodes in your cluster

    `kubectl top node`

* Get the CPU and memory utilization of the pods in your cluster

    `kubectl top pods`

* Get the CPU and memory of pods in all namespaces

    `kubectl top pods --all-namespaces`

* Get the CPU and memory of pods in only one namespace

    `kubectl top pods -n kube-system`

* Get the CPU and memory of pods with a label selector

    `kubectl top pod -l run=pod-with-defaults`

* Get the CPU and memory of a specific pod

    `kubectl top pod pod-with-defaults`

* Get the CPU and memory of the containers inside the pod

    `kubectl top pods group-context --containers`
