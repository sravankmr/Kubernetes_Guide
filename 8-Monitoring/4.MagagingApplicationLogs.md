Containerized applications usually write their logs to standard out and standard error instead of writing their logs to files. 

Docker then redirects those streams to files. 

You can retrieve those files with the kubectl logs command in Kubernetes. 

### Hands-on

* Get the logs from a pod

    `kubectl logs nginx`

* Get the logs from a specific container on a pod

    `kubectl logs counter -c count-log-1`

* Get the logs from all containers on the pod

    `kubectl logs counter --all-containers=true`

* Get the logs from containers with a certain label

    `kubectl logs -lapp=nginx`

* Get the logs from a previously terminated container within a pod

    `kubectl logs -p -c nginx nginx`

* Stream the logs from a container in a pod

    `kubectl logs -f -c count-log-1 counter`

* Tail the logs to only view a certain number of lines

    `kubectl logs --tail=20 nginx`

* View the logs from a previous time duration

    `kubectl logs --since=1h nginx`

* View the logs from a container within a pod within a deployment

    `kubectl logs deployment/nginx -c nginx`

* Redirect the output of the logs to a file

    `kubectl logs counter -c count-log-1 > count.log`
