We are able to monitor the CPU and memory utilization of our pods and nodes by using the metrics server. 

### Hands-on

* Clone the metrics server repository

    `git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/metrics-server`

* Modify `~/metrics-server/deploy/1.8+/metrics-server-deployment.yaml`

    Replace the apiVersion for the deployment from `extensions/v1beta1` to `apps/v1`

* Install the metrics server in your cluster

    `kubectl apply -f ~/metrics-server/deploy/1.8+/`

* Get a response from the metrics server API

    `kubectl get --raw /apis/metrics.k8s.io/`

* Get the CPU and memory utilization of the nodes in your cluster

    `kubectl top node`

* Get the CPU and memory utilization of the pods in your cluster

    `kubectl top pods`

* Get the CPU and memory of pods in all namespaces

    `kubectl top pods --all-namespaces`

* Get the CPU and memory of pods in only one namespace

    `kubectl top pods -n kube-system`

* Get the CPU and memory of pods with a label selector

    `kubectl top pod -l run=pod-with-defaults`

* Get the CPU and memory of a specific pod

    `kubectl top pod pod-with-defaults`

* Get the CPU and memory of the containers inside the pod

    `kubectl top pods group-context --containers`
